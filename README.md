# News - Feeds - Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of **Project Name**. This project is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, with Node.js and Express.js for the backend, Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling, and bcrypt.js for password hashing. It features role-based authentication and authorization using JWT tokens, with separate roles for admin and user. Server-side validations are implemented using express-validator, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are supported.

## Features

- Role-based authentication and authorization (Admin and User roles)
- CRUD operations for managing data
- Server-side validations using express-validator
- Password hashing and security with bcrypt.js
- Cron job implementation using node-cron for scheduled tasks

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (with Mongoose)
  - bcrypt.js
  - express-validator
  - node-cron

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (and npm)
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-backend.git

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   cd project-backend

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and configure the following variables:

   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   
3. Start the server:
     ```bash
   npm start

    This will start the backend server.

### Usage
Once the server is running, the API endpoints can be accessed using a REST client (e.g., Postman). Depending on your role (Admin or User), you'll have access to different endpoints and functionalities. Make sure you're using the appropriate JWT token for authentication.
